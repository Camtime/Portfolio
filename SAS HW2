*The LIBNAME statemnent creates the permanent library named 'cshoupe'; 
LIBNAME cshoupe '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs';

*Below, I am creating a reference to the file and importing it into SAS;
*While importing, I also include the database management system, the new file name, the replace statement (replaces old data with new data), and stating that the first row of the data is a header row.;

FILENAME BEANS '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs/cshoupe_beans.xlsx';

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=BEANS
	DBMS=XLSX
	OUT=cshoupe.Beans
	replace;
	GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

*work.Beans is the copy of the dataset cshoupe.Beans;
*Drop, drops the variable from the output data;
*Rename, renames the variables;
*The IF statement keeps certain rows based on certain string values for the variable Class;
*averageSF is a new variable created by averaging the ShapeFactors;
*The LENGTH statement limts the amount of characters in the variable RndLevel;
*The IF/Else IF/Else statement categorizes the roundness based on certain conditions;

data work.Beans;
    set cshoupe.Beans (drop = Solidity ConvexArea
    				rename = (ShapeFactor1 = SF1
    							ShapeFactor2 = SF2
    							ShapeFactor3 = SF3
    							ShapeFactor4 = SF4));
    				IF (Class = "SIRA") OR (Class = "CALI") OR (Class = "DERMASON") OR (Class = "BOMBAY") OR (Class = "SEKER");
    				averageSF = MEAN(SF1, SF2, SF3, SF4);
    				LENGTH RndLevel $20;
    				If (Roundness > 0.9108305) THEN RndLevel = "Largest Category";
    				Else IF (Roundness > 0.8777096) AND (Roundness <= 0.9108305) THEN RndLevel = "Middle Category";
    				Else RndLevel = "Lowest Category";

Run;

*PROC PRINT prints out the work.beans dataset;
*Where specifies which Roundness categories to print;
*var specifies which variables to print out;

PROC PRINT DATA = work.beans;
	Where (RndLevel = "Lowest Category") or (RndLevel = "Middle Category");
	var Class RndLevel Roundness EquivDiameter Perimeter;  
	
RUN;

*The URL is: https://www.gigasheet.com/sample-data/nba-player-stats-dataset-for-the-2022-2023 ;
*I am interested in this dataset because it inlvolves the NBA, which I am a very big fan of. I also like observing stats on players to make an evaluation of how they are playing.;

FILENAME NbaStats '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs/NBA Player Stats Dataset for the 2022-2023 _exported.csv';
