*Creates reference to the permanenet library 'cshoupe';
LIBNAME cshoupe '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs';

*importing csv file using an URL and then importing the file as a SAS data file, while including the database management system, the library name, the max amount of rows to decide how long a variable is, and info that says the first row is a header row.;
*PROC SORT sorts the data by the variable 'PAIN';
*PROC PRINT prints every row in the dataset;

FILENAME hcData URL 'https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/ST307/Data/cshoupe_horse-colic.csv';

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=hcData
	DBMS=CSV
	OUT=cshoupe.horseColic;
	GUESSINGROWS = MAX;
	GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

PROC SORT DATA = cshoupe.horsecolic;
     BY PAIN;
RUN;

PROC PRINT DATA = cshoupe.horsecolic;
RUN;

*There is a missing value for the PAIN variable;

*LIBNAME creates a reference to the permanent library "cshoupe";
*PROC IMPORT imports data from the tsv file and turns it into a SAS data file;
*DBMS is the Database Management System which is tsv/TAB;
*Out is the library name;
*REPLACE replaces or overwrites data if there is an error or mistake made;
*GUESSINGROWS=MAX tells SAS to look at the max amount of rows to decide how long a variable is;
*GETNAMES=NO tells SAS that the first row is not a header row;

LIBNAME cshoupe '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs';

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE= '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs/cshoupe_glass.tsv'
	DBMS=TAB
	OUT=cshoupe.glass
	replace;
	GUESSINGROWS = MAX;
	GETNAMES=NO;
	
RUN;

*The SET and DATA statement in the DATA step have the same name, so that the RENAME function overwrites the current data;
*The RENAME function renames to columns with the 6 variables given;


DATA cshoupe.glass;
	Set cshoupe.glass;
	Rename VAR1 = K
		VAR2 =	Ca
		VAR3 =	Si
		VAR4 =	Mg
		VAR5 =	Id
		VAR6 =	Fe;
RUN;

*The first value of the variable K is 0.62;

*The first statement is a LIBNAME engine, which reads in raw data for all sheets and creates a permanent library called "zoo";
*SET statement of the DATA step copies the existing zoo datasheet that is placed in the work library;	

LIBNAME zoo xlsx '/home/u63737625/SAS ICAs/cshoupe_zoo.xlsx';

DATA work.Zoo;
	SET zoo.sheet1;
RUN;

*The first value of the catsize variable is 0;
